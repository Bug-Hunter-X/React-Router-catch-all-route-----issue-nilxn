This repository demonstrates a common issue with React Router's catch-all route. The problem arises when a route with a wildcard path ('*') is placed after more specific routes, potentially leading to unintended behavior where the catch-all route always matches.  The solution offers a way to prioritize more specific route paths before employing a catch-all route for unmatched paths.
